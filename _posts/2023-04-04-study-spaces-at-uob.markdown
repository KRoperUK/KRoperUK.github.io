## On Campus

The University of Birmingham is home to many brilliant study spaces.

Here are some of my favourites:

- Collaborative Teaching Laboratory (CTL)
- Guild
- Library (3rd floor, of course)

## Outside of campus

Outside of campus I love working in the following:

- HeyBrew
- Winterbourne

## Finding study spaces

I've made a website that has nearby study spaces with details of where they are and when they're open.
